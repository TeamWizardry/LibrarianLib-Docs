# LibrarianLib

LibrarianLib is a suite of libraries designed to help you express your creativity without having to
sweat the details. You don’t need to keep track of all the events that go into registering a block,
just hand it to LibLib, and we’ll take care of it for you. 

LibrarianLib is fundamentally a Java library. The library itself may be written in Kotlin, but it 
has been built with the focus on being clean and easy to use from Java code. If you encounter any 
rough APIs, please [create an issue](https://github.com/TeamWizardry/LibrarianLib/issues) about it
or join [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/KPaZHvq).

LibrarianLib is rather large, and there's a lot of complex topics to document, so expect this 
documentation to be very incomplete for quite a while. I'm going to write the documentation in a 
tutorial style. If you find any of it especially confusing please contact me (@thecodewarrior) on 
our Discord server so I can help clarify and learn how to improve the docs.
